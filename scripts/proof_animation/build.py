"""Proof-animation CONVERSION library — a ProofTrajectory → animation data.

Deterministic, no LM. Given the expert's output (a ``ProofTrajectory``: a start
state + ordered ``DerivationStep``s), this threads the states so a sub-expression
that persists keeps the SAME node id across states (GumTree-style rebase) and
renders each state to **annotated LaTeX** (``\\htmlData{n=<id>}{...}``) with those
stable ids. The JS engine FLIP-morphs between states keyed on ``data-n``.

This module is the conversion only. The committed test cases live in
``tests/proof_animation/proof_animations.json``; rendering to HTML is ``report.py``;
deriving a proof from a prompt is ``derive.py``.
