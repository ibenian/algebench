"""The refinement engine (issue #372 §C, option B2 — hand-rolled loop).

The pinned DSPy (2.6.5) ships **no** retry primitive (``dspy.Refine`` /
``BestOfN`` were added later; ``dspy.Assert`` / ``Suggest`` were removed), and a
validation failure there is *reject → one blind re-roll → raise* with the
``ValidationError`` text discarded. So the model is never told what was wrong.

This module supplies the missing engine, version-proof and dependency-free: ask,
evaluate, and — crucially — **thread the failure feedback back into the next
attempt** so retries are targeted, not blind. It early-exits the moment an
attempt passes; after ``N`` attempts it keeps the **best** one (honestly tiered
by the confidence badges, per issue #372 §D — refinement raises the ceiling, the
badges keep the floor honest).

The harness is deliberately decoupled from *how* an attempt is produced and
scored: it takes an ``attempt`` callable ``(k, feedback) -> prediction`` and an
``evaluate`` callable ``prediction -> RewardResult`` (anything with ``.score``,
``.passed``, ``.issues``). Swapping in ``dspy.Refine`` after a dependency bump
would replace only this loop — the checkers and reward are identical (#372 §C).
